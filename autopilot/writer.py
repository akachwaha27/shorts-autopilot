Keep the format structure above, but every scene needs a joke: a playful observation, an exaggerated
comparison, a deadpan aside or a callback to an earlier joke. Use setup -> punchline rhythm and land the
biggest laugh on the final item / last scene. Facts stay true; the humor comes from how you tell them.
Never mock real people or any group."""

RETENTION_RULES = f"""SHORTS RETENTION RULES (follow strictly - you are writing for the YouTube Shorts algorithm):
- The first sentence is the hook: max 12 words, creates curiosity or tension in the first second.
  Never start with greetings, "In this video", "Hey guys" or the channel name.
- Promise a payoff early and deliver it near the end, so viewers stay to the last second.
- Write the way a real person talks to a friend, not like an article being read out:
  contractions (it's, you'll, didn't), mixed sentence lengths (a few 3-5 word lines between longer ones),
  natural asides ("honestly", "wait", "here's the thing", "okay, so"), and commas/full stops where a
  speaker would breathe. Avoid stiff phrasing ("Furthermore", "In conclusion", "It is important to note").
  Spell numbers the way you'd say them ("about eleven kilometers", "three hundred years"). No emojis,
  hashtags, symbols or brackets in the narration - it is read aloud.
- Make the last line flow naturally back into the first line so the Short loops seamlessly.
- End by asking ONE specific question viewers can answer in the comments (drives comments), not "like and subscribe".
- LENGTH IS STRICT: the narration (all scene texts together) must be {target_words()} spoken words, give or take 10,
  so the video runs about {config.TARGET_SECONDS} seconds. Fill time with real content (an extra detail per item,
  a reaction, a quick comparison), never with padding or repetition.
- "hook_text": 3-6 words shown on screen during the first scene (bold, curiosity-driven).

CONTENT POLICY (YouTube monetization-safe, advertiser-friendly, general audience 13+):
- No politics, religion, violence, crime, tragedy, sexual content, drugs, gambling, profanity or shock content.
- No medical, legal or financial advice. No claims about real living people. No stereotypes or jokes about any group.
- Facts must be accurate and widely verifiable. Never present fiction as true.
- Not aimed at young children (no "for kids" content).

FOR EVERY SCENE ALSO GIVE:
- "stock_queries": 2 different 2-4 word searches for stock footage that LITERALLY shows what this line talks
  about (the named animal, object, place, food or action - e.g. "red panda tree", "scrabble tiles"), never a mood
  or metaphor ("confused person", "chaos"). Plain nouns only; no brands, logos, people's or event names.
- "image_prompt": vivid AI image prompt, vertical 9:16, no text, no logos, no real people.

METADATA (SEO for YouTube search and suggested):
- "primary_keyword": the exact 2-4 word phrase people type into YouTube search for this video (lowercase).
- "title": max 60 characters, contains the primary_keyword (ideally in the first 3 words), curiosity-driven but honest
  (the video must deliver what the title promises). No ALL CAPS words. At most one emoji.
- "description": line 1 = one-sentence summary that contains the primary_keyword (max 150 chars);
  line 2 = one more sentence using 1-2 related search phrases naturally (no keyword stuffing).
- "thumbnail_text": 2-4 punchy words for the thumbnail (different from the title, high curiosity, no clickbait lies).
- "hashtags": exactly 4: "#shorts", one broad topic hashtag, one niche hashtag, and "{{format_tag}}".
- "tags": 10-15 search keywords/phrases people would type to find this (lowercase, no #), most specific first,
  each clearly about this video (no unrelated popular tags, no people's or brand names).
- "pinned_comment": an expert creator's first comment (max 220 chars) that sparks replies: a bonus fact, a
  "which one would you pick" choice, or a challenge tied to the video. Friendly, no links, no begging for
  likes/subs, no spoilers for quizzes before people answer, at most 1 emoji.
- "key_facts": every factual claim made (empty list for pure fiction)."""
