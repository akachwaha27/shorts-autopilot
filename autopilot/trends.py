ALREADY USED - every idea below was sent before. Do NOT repeat any of them, reword them, or pick the same subject

Pick genuinely NEW subjects, and vary the themes (don't keep coming back to phones, tech settings or inventions):

Choose exactly {count or config.TOPICS_PER_DAY} ideas for ORIGINAL Shorts of about one minute (55-65 seconds). Use the trends as inspiration
(ride the curiosity around them with a SAFE ANGLE); if the trends are weak, use proven evergreen Shorts ideas.
Mix FORMATS - use at least 4 different ones across the list, max 2 of the same:
- "ranking": Top 5 countdown with a clear, checkable measure ("Top 5 fastest animals on Earth")
- "story": original wholesome/mystery/twist mini story, clearly fiction (e.g. inspired by a trending holiday or event mood)
- "funny": kind, family-friendly humor: relatable everyday situations, funny-but-true facts, absurd observations
- "quiz": 3-question trivia challenge viewers play along with
- "tips": quick, genuinely useful everyday tips/hacks (tech, home, cooking, travel, productivity)
- "explainer": surprising "why/how" curiosity facts
- "clips": "Ranking the funniest animal moments" - real free stock clips of animals doing funny things
  (dogs, cats, goats, ducks, parrots, monkeys...), ranked #5 to #1. Keep it about ANIMALS only (one animal
  type or animals in general), e.g. "Ranking the funniest goat moments", "Top 5 funniest dog reactions"

idea AND at least one FUNNY "ranking" (a Top 5 that is played for laughs, e.g. "Top 5 animals with ridiculous
sleeping habits", "Top 5 inventions that made no sense", "Top 5 weirdest world records"). Funny ideas must be
kind and family-friendly, and must not be pushed to the bottom: give them honest virality scores.''' if config.FUNNY_PER_DAY else ''}

Hard rules - reject any idea that:
- involves politics, elections, government, war, crime, death, disasters, religion, health/medical or financial
  advice, lawsuits, celebrity gossip/drama, real living people, or anything divisive, shocking or likely to offend;
- would need someone else's footage, music, characters or likeness;
- makes claims that can't be verified; or is aimed at young children.
